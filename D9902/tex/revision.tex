\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Added A*, Best-first search and Adamic-Adar Index to Tier 2 algorithms.
      \item Removed allocator parameters for consistency with algorithms in general. More input is needed before we can add allocators.
      \item Removed exception throwing from algorithms to reduce friction. 
            This may be revisited in the future, based on input.
\end{itemize}
