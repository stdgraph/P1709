\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Added A*, Best-first search and Adamic-Adar Index to Tier 2 algorithms based on input.
      \item Removed allocator parameters for consistency with existing algorithms. It was observed that \tcode{stable_sort} 
            allocates memory, but does not take an allocator parameter.
      \item Removed exception throwing from algorithms to support free-standing C++. The caller will need to
            follow the preconditions to avoid undefined behavior. The other option considered was to return
            an error code.
      \item Identify all \tcode{concept} definitions as "For exposition only" until we have consensus of whether they 
            belong in the standard or not.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Move Breadth-First Search out of the Shortest Paths section to avoid confusion.
      \item Revise Dijkstra's algorithms to include a visitor parameter to match boost::graph.
            Also removed extra overloads to keep the proposal small, until we get more input.
\end{itemize}
