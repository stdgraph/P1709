\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Added A*, Best-first search and Adamic-Adar Index to Tier 2 algorithms based on input.
      \item Removed allocator parameters for consistency with existing algorithms. It was observed that \tcode{stable_sort} 
            allocates memory, but does not take an allocator parameter.
      \item Removed exception throwing from algorithms to support free-standing C++. The caller will need to
            follow the preconditions to avoid undefined behavior. The other option considered was to return
            an error code.
\end{itemize}
