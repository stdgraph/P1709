\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Added A*, Best-first search and Adamic-Adar Index to Tier 2 algorithms based on input.
      \item Removed allocator parameters for consistency with existing algorithms. It was observed that \tcode{stable_sort} 
            allocates memory, but does not take an allocator parameter.
      \item Removed exception throwing from algorithms to support free-standing C++. The caller will need to
            follow the preconditions to avoid undefined behavior. The other option considered was to return
            an error code.
      \item Identify all \tcode{concept} definitions as "For exposition only" until we have consensus of whether they 
            belong in the standard or not.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Move Breadth-First Search to the Traversal section to avoid confusion when it was in the Shortest Paths section.
      \item Revise the Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford shortest-path and shortest-distance algorithms
            \begin{itemize}
                  \item Add a visitor parameter to match boost::graph. Each algorithm uses a different visitor class.
                  \item Remove overloads that excluded Compare and Combine functions because they don't add much value,
                        and to keep the proposal small.
                  \item Add overloads for multiple sources. This is particularly important for Bellman-Ford to avoid
                        repeated calls to the algorithm that would make an already slow algorithm even slower.
            \end{itemize}
      \item Add the ability to detect and find the negative weight cycle in the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
\end{itemize}
