\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} chapter.
      \item Move text for graph data structures created from std containers from Graph Container Interface to 
            Container Implementation paper.
      \item GCI overloads are no longer required for adjacency lists constructed with standard containers. Data structures that follow
            the pattern \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<integral>>} and \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<tuple<integral,...>>>}
            are automatically recognized as an adjacency list, including containers from non-standard libraries. The \tcode{integral}
            value is used as the target\_id.
\end{itemize}
