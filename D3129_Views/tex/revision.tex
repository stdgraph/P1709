\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Removed allocator parameters on views, for consistency with existing views in the standard. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Add the edgelist as an abstract data structure as a peer to the adjacency list. 
            The range returned by \tcode{edgelist_view} adheres to the \tcode{basic_sourced_index_edgelist} concept,
            and to the \tcode{has_edge_value} concept if a \tcode{evf(uv)} function is passed. The same applies to
            all \textit{sourced} versions of the BFS, DFS and Topological Sort views.
      \item Restore the allocator parameters on the DFS, BFS and Toplogical Sort views, based on feedback and 
            by SG14/SG19 joint meeting.
      \item Add a note that we will be unable to support a freestanding graph library in this proposal because
            of the need for \tcode{stack}, \tcode{queue} and potential \tcode{bad_alloc} exception in many of 
            the views.
      \item Rename \tcode{descriptor} structs to \tcode{info} structs in preparation for new BGL-like descriptors.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r2}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Replace the use of \textit{id} and \textit{reference} with \textit{descriptor}, leading to a simpler
            interace with fewer functions. It also creates a more flexible interface that can support vertices in
            map-like containers in the future.
\end{itemize}
