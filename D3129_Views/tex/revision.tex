\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Removed allocator parameters on views, for consistency with existing views in the standard. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Add the edgelist as an abstract data structure as a peer to the adjacency list. 
            The range returned by \tcode{edgelist_view} adheres to the \tcode{basic_sourced_index_edgelist} concept,
            and to the \tcode{has_edge_value} concept if a \tcode{evf(uv)} function is passed. The same applies to
            all \textit{sourced} versions of the BFS, DFS and Topological Sort views.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r2}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Restore the allocator parameters on the DFS, BFS and Toplogical Sort views, based on feedback and 
            by SG14/SG19 joint meeting.
\end{itemize}
