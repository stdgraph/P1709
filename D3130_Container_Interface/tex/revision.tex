\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Add default implementation for \tcode{target_id(g,uv)} when the graph type matches the 
            pattern \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<integral>>} or \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<tuple<integral,...>>>};
            \tcode{vertex_id_t<G>} also defaults to the \tcode{integral} type given.
      \item Revised concept definitions, adding \tcode{sourced_targeted_edge} and \tcode{target_edge_range}, and replaced
            summary table with code for clarity. Also assured that all combinations of adjacency list concepts for
            \textit{basic}, \textit{sourced} and \textit{index} exist.
      \item Move text for graph data structures created from std containers from Graph Container Interface to 
            Container Implementation paper.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Add \tcode{num_edges(g)} and \tcode{has_edge(g)} functions. Split function table into 3 tables for graph,
            vertex and edge functions because it was getting too big.
\end{itemize}
