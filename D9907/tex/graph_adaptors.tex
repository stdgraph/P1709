\section{Graph Adaptors}

%\andrew{A facade for turning a range of ranges into something that meets the requirements of an edge list and/or an adjacency list.  
%Particularly important for wrapping up an actual range of ranges -- e.g., vector<list>.  Just maps things like size() to num\_vertices() 
%and the like.  Also keeps track of num\_vertices in certain situations, e.g., in an edge list or in a bipartite graph where size() doesn't 
%mean the same thing as num\_vertices().}


\section{Edge List Adaptor}

\andrew{Need an adaptor to convert an edgelist to an adjacency\_list.}
