\section{compressed\_graph Graph Container}
\tcode{compressed_graph} is a graph container being proposed for the standard library. It is a high-performance data structure that 
uses \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix#Compressed_sparse_row_\%28CSR\%2C_CRS_or_Yale_format\%29}{Compressed Sparse Row} 
(CSR) format to store its vertices, edges and associated values. Once constructed, vertices and edges cannot be added or deleted 
but values on vertices and edges can be modified.

There are a number of features added beyond the typical CSR implmentation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item   \textbf{User-defined values} The typical CSR implementation stores values on edges (columns) by defining the \tcode{EV}
            template paraemter. \tcode{compressed_graph} extends that to also allow values on vertices (rows) and the graph itself 
            by defining the \tcode{VV} and \tcode{GV} template arguments respectively. If a type is void, no memory overhead is incurred.
    \item   \textbf{Index type sizes} The size of the integral indexes into the internal vertex (row) and edge (column) structures can be 
            controlled by the \tcode{VId} and \tcode{EIndex} template arguments respectively to give a balance between capacity, memory 
            usage and performance.
    \item   \textbf{Multi-partite graphs} The vertices can optionally be partitioned into multiple partitions by passing the 
            starting vertex id of each partition in the \tcode{partition_start_ids} argument in the constructors. If no partitions are
            specified, the graph is single-partite.
\end{itemize}

The listings in the following sections show the prototypes for the \tcode{compressed_graph} when the graph value type \tcode{GV} is 
non-\tcode{void} (section \ref{compressed_full}) and a class template specialization when it is \tcode{void} (section \ref{compressed_specialization}).

Only the constuctors and destructor shown for \tcode{compressed_graph} are public. All other types and functions related to the graph
are only accessible through the types and functions in the Graph Container Interface.

$P$ is the number of partitions and is exepected to be small, e.g. $P = 2$ for bipartite and $P \leq 10$ for typical 
multi-partite graphs.

\phil{Is it possible to support movable EV and VV types?}

\begin{itemdescr}
    \pnum\mandates
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \tcode{EV} template argument for an edge value must be a copyable type or \tcode{void.}
            \item The \tcode{VV} template argument for a vertex value must be a copyable type or \tcode{void.}
            \item When the \tcode{GV} template argument for a graph value is not \tcode{void} it can be movable or copyable. It must have a 
                  default constructor if it is not passed in a \tcode{compressed_graph} constructor.
            \item The \tcode{EProj} template argument must be a projection that returns a value of \tcode{copyable_edge<VId, true, EV>} type
                  given a value of \tcode{erng}. If the value type of \tcode{ERng} is already a \tcode{copyable_edge<VId, true, EV>} type, 
                  then \tcode{EProj} can be \tcode{identity}.
            \item The \tcode{VProj} template argument must be a projection that returns a value of \tcode{copyable_vertex<VId, VV>} type,
                  given a value of \tcode{vrng}. If the value type of \tcode{Vrng} is already a \tcode{copyable_vertex<VId, VV>} type, 
                  then \tcode{VProj} can be \tcode{identity}.
        \end{itemize}
    \pnum\preconditions
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \tcode{VId} template argument must be able to store a value of |V|+1, where |V| is the
                  number of vertices in the graph. The size of this type impacts the size of the \textit{edges}.
            \item The \tcode{EIndex} template argument must be able to store a value of |E|+1, where |E| is the
                  number of edges in the graph. The size of this type impact the size of the \textit{vertices}.
            \item The \tcode{EProj} and \tcode{VProj} template arguments must be valid projections.
            \item The \tcode{partition_start_ids} range includes the starting vertex id for each partition. If it is empty, then the graph is single-partite
                    and the number of partitions is 1. If it is not empty, then the number of partitions is the size of the range, where the first element
                    must be 0 and all elements are in ascending order. A vertex id in the range must not exceed the number of 
                    vertices in the graph. Any violation of these conditions results in undefined behavior.
        \end{itemize}
\phil{If duplicate partition\_start\_ids exist they create an empty partition with no vertices.}

    \pnum\effects
        \begin{itemize}
            \item When \tcode{EV}, \tcode{VV}, or \tcode{GV} are \tcode{void}, no extra memory overhead is incurred for that type.
         \end{itemize}

    %\pnum\returns \lstinline{void} \\
    %\pnum\throws \tcode{out_of_range} is thrown when \tcode{source} is not in the range \tcode{0 <= source < num_vertices(graph)}.  \\
    %\pnum\complexity \\
    \pnum\remarks 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  The \tcode{VId} and \tcode{EIndex} template arguments impact the capacity, internal storage requirements and performance.
                   The default of \tcode{uint32_t} is sufficient for most graphs and provides a good balance between storage and performance.

                   The memory requirements are roughly, 
                        \[|V| \times (sizeof(EIndex)+sizeof(VV)) + |E| \times (sizeof(VId) + sizeof(EV)) + sizeof(GV)\]
                   where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph. $sizeof$ \tcode{void} is 0
                   when considering $sizeof$ for \tcode{VV}, \tcode{EV}, and \tcode{GV}. Alignment and overhead for internal vectors are 
                   not included in this calculation.
            \item The allocator passed to constructors is rebound for different types used by different internal containers.

\section{Using Existing Graph Data Structures}
Reasonable defaults have been defined for the GCI functions to minimize the amount of work
needed to adapt an existing graph data structure to be used by the views and algorithms.

There are two cases supported. The first is for the use of standard containers to define the graph and the other
is for a broader set of more complicated implementations.

\subsection{Using Standard Containers for the Graph Data Structure}

For example this we'll use \tcode{G = vector<forward_list<tuple<int,double>>>} to define the graph, where \tcode{g} 
is an instance of \tcode{G}. \tcode{tuple<int,double>} defines the target\_id and weight property respectively. We
can write loops to go through the vertices, and edges within each vertex, as follows.

\begin{lstlisting}
using G = vector<forward_list<tuple<int,double>>>;
auto weight = [&g](edge_t& uv) { return get<1>(uv); }

G g;
load_graph(g, ...); // load some data

// Using GCI functions
for(auto&& [uid, u] : vertices(g)) {
  for(auto&& [vid, uv]: edges(g,u)) {
    auto w = weight(uv);
    // do something...
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that no function override was required and is a special case when the outer range is a \tcode{random_access_range} and
and inner inner range is a \tcode{forward_range}, and the value type of the inner range is either \tcode{integral}
 or \tcode{tuple<integral, ...>}. This extends to any range type. For instance, boost::containers can be used
 just as easily as std containers.

    {\begin{tabular}{l l p{1.5cm} L{7.0cm}}
    \hline
        \textbf{Function or Value} & \textbf{Concrete Type} \\
    \hline
        \tcode{vertices(g)} & \tcode{vector<forward_list<tuple<int,double>>>} (when \tcode{random_access_range<G>}) \\
        \tcode{u} & \tcode{forward_list<tuple<int,double>>} & \\
        \tcode{edges(g,u)} & \tcode{forward_list<tuple<int,double>>} (when \tcode{random_access_range<vertex_range_t<G>>}) \\
        \tcode{uv} & \tcode{tuple<int,double>} & \\
        \tcode{edge_value(g,uv)} & \tcode{tuple<int,double>} (when \tcode{random_access_range<vertex_range_t<G>>}) \\
        \tcode{target_id(g,uv)} & \tcode{integral}, when \tcode{uv} is either \tcode{integral}  or \tcode{tuple<integral,...>} \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}}

    \end{center}
\end{table}


\subsection{Using Other Graph Data Structures}
For other graph data structures more function overrides are required. Table \ref{tab:cmn_cpo_overrides} shows the 
common function overrides anticipated for most cases, keeping in mind that all functions can be overridden.
When they are defined they must be in the same namespace as the data structures.

    \hline
        \tcode{vertices(g)} & \\
        \tcode{edges(g,u)} & \\
        \tcode{target_id(g,uv)} & \\
        \tcode{edge_value(g,uv)} & If edges have value(s) in the graph \\
        \tcode{vertex_value(g,u)} & If vertices have value(s) in the graph \\
        \tcode{graph_value(g)} & If the graph has value(s) \\
