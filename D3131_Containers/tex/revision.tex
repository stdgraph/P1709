\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Move text for graph data structures created from std containers from Graph Container Interface to 
            Container Implementation paper.
      \item GCI overloads are no longer required for adjacency lists constructed with standard containers. Data structures that follow
            the pattern \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<integral>>} and \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<tuple<integral,...>>>}
            are automatically recognized as an adjacency list, including containers from non-standard libraries. The \tcode{integral}
            value is used as the target\_id.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Added complexity for \tcode{num_edges(g)} and \tcode{has_edge(g)} functions in \tcode{compressed_graph}.
      \item Removed the Load Graph Data section with it's load functions from \href{https://www.wg21.link/P3130}{P3130 Graph Container Interface}
            because it unnecessarily complicates the interface with constructors for graph data structures. To complement this, constructors have 
            been added for \tcode{compressed_graph} in \href{https://www.wg21.link/P3131}{P3131 Graph Containers}. An optional \tcode{partition_start_ids} 
            parameter has also been added to constructors to identify the first vertex id of each partition for multi-partite graphs.
      \item Added feature summary of \tcode{compressed_graph} beyond the typical CSR implementation.
\end{itemize}
