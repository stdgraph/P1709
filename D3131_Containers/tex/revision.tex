\section{Revision History}

\subsection*{\paperno r0}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Split from P1709r5. Added \textit{Getting Started} section.
      \item Move text for graph data structures created from std containers from Graph Container Interface to 
            Container Implementation paper.
      \item GCI overloads are no longer required for adjacency lists constructed with standard containers. Data structures that follow
            the pattern \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<integral>>} and \tcode{random_access_range<forward_range<tuple<integral,...>>>}
            are automatically recognized as an adjacency list, including containers from non-standard libraries. The \tcode{integral}
            value is used as the target\_id.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r1}
\begin{itemize}
      \item Added feature summary of \tcode{compressed_graph} beyond the typical CSR implementation.
      \item Added complexity for \tcode{num_edges(g)} and \tcode{has_edge(g)} functions in \tcode{compressed_graph}.
      \item Add constructors to \tcode{compressed_graph} to complement the removal of the load functions from 
            \href{https://www.wg21.link/P3130r1}{P3130r1 Graph Container Interface}. An optional \tcode{partition_start_ids} 
            parameter is also included.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\paperno r2}

\begin{itemize}
      \item Add the edgelist as an abstract data structure as a peer to the adjacency list. 
            A section on edgelists has been added to Using Existing Data Structures.
      \item Add \tcode{is_directed} item in the feature summary box to \tcode{compressed_graph}.
\end{itemize}
