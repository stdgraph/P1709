\section{Degree}
Degree of a vertex in graph theory refers to the number of edges that are incident to the vertex. Although the proposal provides customization point interface to access a degree of an individual vertex, a degree operator allows one to build a range of degrees of all vertices within a graph.

            \item
                  \lstinline{graph} is an \lstinline{adjacency_list}, which can be directed or undirected. \muhammad{Support other graph types as well?}

      \pnum\effects Output iterator \lstinline{degrees_per_vertex} contains the degree of each vertex in the graph, accessible through \lstinline{degrees_per_vertex[uid]}, where uid is the \lstinline{vertex_id}. The caller must assure \lstinline{size(degrees_per_vertex) >= size(vertices(graph))}.
      \pnum\complexity $\mathcal{O}(|V|)$ where $V$ is the number of vertices in the graph.

\section{Sort}
Sort operator comes in many different variants, allows to sort the input graph based on the source vertex, target vertex, the degree of the vertex or by the weight on the edges. Also relevant, \lstinline{topological_sort}, which returns a nonunique permutation of the vertices of a directed acyclic graph such that an edge from u to v implies that u appears before v in the topological sort order.
