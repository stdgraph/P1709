Reading them in order will give the best overall picture.
If you're limited on time, you can use the following guide to focus on the papers that are most relevant to your needs.

\textbf{Reading Guide} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you're \textbf{new to the Graph Library}, we recommend starting with the \textit{Overview} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3126}{P3126}) paper to understand the focus and scope of our proposals.
        You'll also want to check out how it stacks up against other graph libraries in performance and usage syntax in the \textit{Comparison} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3337}{P3337}) paper.
  \item If you want to \textbf{understand the terminology and theoretical background} that underpins what we're doing, you should read the \textit{Background and Terminology} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3127}{P3127}) paper.
  \item If you want to \textbf{use the algorithms}, you should read the \textit{Algorithms} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3128}{P3128}) and \textit{Graph Containers} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3131}{P3131}) papers.
        You may also find the \textit{Views} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3129}{P3129}) and \textit{Graph Container Interface} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3130}{P3130}) papers helpful. 
  \item If you want to \textbf{write new algorithms}, you should read the \textit{Views} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3129}{P3129}), \textit{Graph Container Interface} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3130}{P3130}), and \textit{Graph Containers} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3131}{P3131}) papers.
        You'll also want to review existing implementations in the reference library for examples of how to write the algorithms.
  \item If you want to \textbf{use your own graph data structures}, you should read the \textit{Graph Container Interface} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3130}{P3130}) and \textit{Graph Containers} (\href{https://www.wg21.link/P3131}{P3131}) papers.
