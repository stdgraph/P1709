\section{Getting Started}

This paper is one of several interrelated papers for a proposed Graph Library for the Standard C++ Library. 
The Table \ref{tab:papers} describes all the related papers. 

Their order represents different layers of the library. Reading them in order will give the best overall picture, 
but you're welcome to read in any order for the area that interests you the most.

\textbf{Reading Guide:} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item If you're \textbf{new to the Graph Library}, we recommend starting with the \textit{Overview} paper (P9901).
  \item If you want to \textbf{understand the theoretical background} underpins what we're doing, you should read the \textit{Background and Terminology} paper (P9908).
  \item If you want to \textbf{use the algorithms}, you should read the \textit{Algorithms} paper (P9902) and \textbf{Graph Container Implementations} paper (9906).
  \item If you want to \textbf{write algorithms}, you should read the \textit{Views} paper (P9905), \textit{Graph Container Interface} paper (P9905) and \textit{Graph Container Implementations} paper (P9906).
  \item If you want to \textbf{use your own graph container}, you should read the \textit{Graph Container Interface} paper (P9905) and \textit{Graph Container Implementations} paper (P9906).
