\section{Getting Started}

This paper is one of several interrelated papers for a proposed Graph Library for the Standard C++ Library. 
The Table \ref{tab:papers} describes all the related papers. 

Their order represents different layers of the library. Reading them in order will give the best overall picture, 
but you're welcome to read in any order for the area that interests you the most.

       P9901              & Active         & \textbf{Overview and Introduction}, describing the big
                                             picture of what we are proposing. \\
       P9902              & Active         & \textbf{Algorithms} covering the initial algorithms 
                                             as well as the ones we'd like to see in the future. \\

                                             working with graphs. \\

       P9905              & Active         & \textbf{Graph Container Interface} is the core interface used
                                             for uniformly accessing graph data structures by views and algorithms.
                                             It is also designed to easily adapt to existing graph data structures.\\

                                             and a new  high-performance \tcode{compressed_graph} container, based on a
