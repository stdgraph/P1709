\chapter{Graph Adaptors}

\andrew{A facade for turning a range of ranges into something that meets the requirements of an edge list and/or an adjacency list.  
Particularly important for wrapping up an actual range of ranges -- e.g., vector<list>.  Just maps things like size() to num\_vertices() 
and the like.  Also keeps track of num\_vertices in certain situations, e.g., in an edge list or in a bipartite graph where size() doesn't 
mean the same thing as num\_vertices().}


\section{Edge List Adaptor}

\phil{With the new edgelist view (discussed with Kevin), do we need any adaptors?}

\phil{Need an adaptor to convert an edgelist to an adjacency\_list (from Andrew).}


\section{Adjacency List Adaptor}

\phil{With the current defaults, \tcode{vector<vector<tuple<int,double>>>} only needs \tcode{target_id(g,uv)} overridden.}
