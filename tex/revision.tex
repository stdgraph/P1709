\section*{P1709R4}
This was a major redesign that incorporated all the experience and input from the past 3 years.
\begin{itemize}
\item Reduce the scope to focus on an edge list and adjacency graph with outgoing edges only, and remove mutable interface functions. 
\item Replace directed and undirected concepts with overridable types of unordered\_edge for a graph implementation type.
\item Simplify the Graph Container types and functions. In particular, const and non-const variations were consolidated to a single definition to handle both cases 
when appropriate.
\item All Graph Container Interface functions are customization points.
\item Introduce Views, inspired by NWGraph design, resulting in simpler and cleaner interfaces to traverse a graph, and simplifying the container interface design.
\item Revisit the algorithms to be considered. transitive\_closure has been dropped. The final list hasn't been finalized yet.
\item Replace the two container implementations with compressed\_graph, based on the Compressed Sparse Row matrix.
\end{itemize}

\section*{P1709R3}
A simple status revision to say a major change is coming soon.

\section*{P1709R2}
Define the \textbf{uniform API} for undirected and directed algorithms (an extended API also exists for directed graphs). Added \textbf{concepts} for undirected, directed and bidirected graphs. Refined \textbf{DFS} and \textbf{BFS} range definitions from prototype experience. Refined \textbf{shortest paths} and \textbf{transitive closure} algorithms from input and prototype experience.

\section*{P1709R1}
Rewrite with a focus on a \textbf{purely functional design}, emphasizing the algorithms and graph API. Also added \textbf{concepts} and \textbf{ranges} into the design. Addressed concerns from Cologne review to change to functional design.

\section*{P1709R0}
Focus on \textbf{object-oriented API} for data structures and example code for a few algorithms.
